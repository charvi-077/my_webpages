<h1 style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive;"><em>Namaste !</em><br><span style="font-size: 0.7em; font-weight: bold;">I do what I love, I love what I do</span></h1>

<p>I am MS student at <a href="https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Barbara</a> and graduate researcher at the <a href="https://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Vision Research Lab</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/bs-manjunath" target="_blank">B. S. Manjunath</a>. My interests lie at the intersection of 2D/3D computer vision and robotics, focusing on systems that can see, understand, and interact with the world through visual intelligence and geometric reasoning.</p>

<p>Before UCSB, I was a Research Associate at IIIT Hyderabad, advised by Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5i1t_QgAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Harikumar Kandath</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oLJTcXIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Ravi Kiran</a>, and previously worked as a Robotics Software Engineer at <a href="https://fluxauto.ai/" target="_blank">Flux Auto</a>, an Intern at <a href="https://www.blackcoffeerobotics.com/" target="_blank">Black Coffee Robotics</a>, and as an Outreachy Developer Intern at <a href="https://git-scm.com/community" target="_blank">Git</a>. I combine research with engineering skills to solve real-world vision problems across robotics, geospatial analysis, and scientific imaging. I am open to opportunities and collaborations in 2D/3D computer vision and always happy to chat if you’re exploring similar ideas.</p>
