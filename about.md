> Hi! I’m Charvi Mendiratta, a software engineer and researcher with a deep interest in robotics, computer vision, and AI systems designed for real-world impact.

> Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, specializing in signal processing and machine learning. I'm also contributing to the [BisQue](https://github.com/UCSB-VRL/bisqueUCSB) Project at the [Vision Research Lab](https://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/), where I’m helping build a scalable, containerized platform for image analysis tasks like classification, segmentation, and small object detection—particularly in challenging datasets like wildlife aerial imagery.

> Previously, I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer at [Flux Auto](https://fluxauto.ai/), where I focused on 3D LiDAR-based SLAM, dynamic obstacle tracking, and real-time map generation for autonomous warehouse vehicles. My experience also spans research roles at [RRC, IIIT Hyderabad](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) and [Panjab University](), where I worked on vision pipelines for civil infrastructure assessment and ecological monitoring systems.

> Beyond engineering, I’ve contributed to open source through an Outreachy internship with Git, and I’m a proud recipient of the ROSCON Diversity Scholarship and Smart India Hackathon Winner.

> Whether it’s building scalable AI pipelines, solving complex robotics problems, or collaborating on research-driven initiatives, I love bridging the gap between theory and impactful technology.

> Let’s connect if you’re working on exciting problems in AI, robotics, or vision systems!
