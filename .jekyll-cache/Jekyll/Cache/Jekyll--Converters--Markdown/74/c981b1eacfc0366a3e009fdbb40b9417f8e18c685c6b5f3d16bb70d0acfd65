<h2 id="progress">Progress:</h2>
<p>Worked on the reviews received on the previous patch series <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAPSFM5fL3_pkMNBYSXiRHzbqOwzA0SBH3NjU+zVq3Mxv7UgL4w@mail.gmail.com/T/#m72ee5cbf7bcff22788912a02849acf18cc82fb32">Implementation of â€œamend!â€ commit</a> (Thanks to Junio for the suggestions). Firstly, we need to improve the implementation of parsing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup_message</code> to detect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword</code>, so instead of checking if â€˜:â€™ occurs before â€˜^â€™ or â€˜@â€™, Junio suggested to add helper function that does strspn(alpha). Secondly, to remove â€˜-mâ€™ commit message option working with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword</code> suboptions, here I agree with Junioâ€™s point that it is more expected to edit the original commit message while preparing â€œamend!â€ commit and using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-m</code> for directly appending the commit message may result in the confusion at the user end.
Next, there was a bug with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword</code> option that was taking changes when passed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pathspec</code>, or with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interactive_patch</code> options. So we need to add a check and error it out. Besides this there were few changes required in commit message and to update the documentation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-commit</code> with above mentioned changes and also to mention about the authorship of the fixed up commit.</p>

<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210225100855.25530-1-charvi077@gmail.com/T/#u">v2 - Implementation of â€œamend!â€ commit</a></p>

<p>Next, started working on the â€œdrop!â€ commit patch series <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git/commits/drop-patches/drop-commit">workbranch</a>. Till now we are able to create the â€œdrop!â€ commit using command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git revert --drop</code>. And, coming to the working of â€œdrop!â€ commit upon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--autosquash</code>, it is currently resulting in segmentation fault, maybe we need to add check if â€œdrop!â€ commit is rearranged or not in rebase todo-help and still I am working on it. Next, as pointed by Phillip we also need to look for the working of the chain of the â€œdrop!â€ commits, which I think to check for commit subject starting with â€œdrop! dropâ€ as in this case we donâ€™t need to change the command of previous commit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pick</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drop</code> in rebase todo-listâ€¦Work still in progressâ€¦</p>

<p>Will continue to work on the â€œdrop!â€ commit patch series that includes to solve the bug, complete the working of â€œdrop!â€ commit upon â€“autosquash and to add the tests and documentation for the same.</p>
